# Plazma Burst 2 Archive

The Archives of Plazma Burst 2 Flash with the newest open sourced resources.

1. Installation (Windows 10)  
- Unpack contents of Plazma Burst 2.zip archieve where this file is located
- Run PB2Launcher.exe file (one with icon)
- On first run you might get "Windows protected your PC" screen,
From here you can proceed by clicking "More info" and then "Run anyway"
(sure if you trust website from where you've downloaded this application,
it must be https://www.plazmaburst2.com )
- During first launch you might be prompted to install .NET Core framework
from Microsoft official website, you'll need x84 or 32-bit version of 
.NET Core framework for this application. Reboot is not needed.
- Run PB2Launcher.exe or you can also optionally create shortcut by
dragging and holding Alt key.

2. Account security  
We do not recommend to redistribute contents of this folder to other
players nor execute other players' standalone versions. Not just because
"data" folder contains account info, but because executing .swf files of
unknown origin can be generally unsafe. Standalone version of this game
should be downloaded from official website whenever possible.

3. Troubleshooting  
Plazma Burst 2 launcher requires Windows 10, but it can work under 
Windows 7 too (might have visual artifacts). Installation should be same
for Windows 7. Application is not tested under Windows 8, and might not
work under earlier versions such as Windows XP (though Flash Player from 
"data" folder should still work fine). 
We also had few cases when Microsoft .NET Core x86 had to be reinstalled (application would silently not start). In this case you can re-download  x86 (!) version from here https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/current/runtime
